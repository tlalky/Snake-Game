# Snake-Game
A different take on classic Snake Game

Game can be paused ( that's what I tried to show with Score = 6 ):

User is able to go beyond screen size causing to spawn on the other side of the screen. 

When food is eaten small animation is played.

Since the user can bypass the screen borders, the only way to end the game is to hit your tail.
